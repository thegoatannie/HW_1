Dear Internet,
  Who was I before you? What did I do when the sun fell but the night was still young? How did I complain to a loved one about the qualms of my annoying roommate without my iPhone 13, my iPhone 8+, and before that, my iPhone 5? Did I seriously throw on a jacket, lace up my converse high tops, and brace the summer heat to run over to their homes? I remember, I spent almost every day from when I could walk to middle school with the daughter of the mother who made absolutely mouth-watering pan-fried pork buns -- whether that be because of Asian parent negligence or because of the pan-fried pork buns (perhaps both), who knows -- but I was never bored. And it wasn't because we had an endless amount of baking recipes to try or pillow forts to build. It was because of you, dear Internet. You taught the daughter of the mother who made absolutely mouth-watering pan-fried pork buns, and she taught me. Going against curfew and secretly huddled under blankets, we would discover the beauty of you. While the city slept, we watched the Star Spangled Banner played on a cat calculator, watched anime with a girl obsessed with an emo guy who transformed into a cat, and we tamed squarish cats with other squarish cat-lovers across the globe on Minecraft, the world of not just squarish cats but also many squarish things. To conclude, you are my savior. Others might think regrettingly about the times when "things were simpler," when people weren't all reduced to weird social recluses. But, as a natural born, weird social recluse, you are only a blessing. It is Friday night. Outside my window, the neighbor's home blinks with rainbow lights and the smell of alcohol and consistent bass and chatter. Their urban outfitters corsets and sweaty button-downs jump up and down, mouths open with laughter. Absolutely dreadful. I call my partner, turn on YouTube's playlist of soft Japanese city-pop, jump into farming starfruit on Stardew Valley, and smile. Thank you.

From, Annie
